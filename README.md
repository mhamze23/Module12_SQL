Module 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

Your Task
Developers often need to design interfaces that enable non-developers to effortlessly access and interact with data stored in databases. These interfaces, known as content management systems (CMS), serve as user-friendly tools for managing various types of data. In this assignment, you are tasked with developing a command-line application from the ground up. This application will manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL as the core technologies.
